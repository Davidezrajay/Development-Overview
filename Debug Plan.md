# Debug plan (08/22/2018)

### Goal: Create a place to log small issues and collect data on bugs, complaints, and potential issue without cluttering GitHub Issues

### Process:
1) Create Issue in appropriate repository
2) Assemble all documentation (images, texts, etc) into a GitHub ticket
3) If low priority, on lacking information close issue, use appropriate Tag and move to Ice Box in Git Project such as https://github.com/Greenstand/treetracker-android/projects/1
4) If high priority, keep issue open (or reopen) issue and assign a developer to verify or recreate the problem and request more info from the field if necessary
5) Deploy a set of test scenarios to isolate the root cause
