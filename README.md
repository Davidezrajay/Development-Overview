# Welcome to GreenStand's Tree Tracker project

We are here to make the world a cooler, richer and greener place.  

**Basic Overview:** The [treetracker-android](https://github.com/Greenstand/treetracker-android) app is a tool to allow planters to verify tree planting and tree survival with geo-tagged, time-stamped images. The tree images are to be analyzed using the [treetracker-admin](https://github.com/Greenstand/treetracker-admin) and then displayed and shared via tokens/links on the [treetracker-web-map](https://github.com/Greenstand/treetracker-web-map). This map is embedded on other organizations websites. 

## Development needs as of 10/08/2018

Here are immediate and long-term needs. Here are a few, if you don’t see a project that fits, come check in on [Slack link](https://join.slack.com/t/greenstand/shared_invite/enQtMjcyMzgyMjk4NzU3LWZmNjM3YzY5N2Q0MzQ5YTM4OGZkMWJhM2U4MTkyYjI2NjhkN2YxNTRiMDIwNWQ5ZTVlNDczYzBjZmMxYzM2ZjU) and let’s figure out how to leverage your skills, don’t be shy there are lots to a do and great community to plug into!

- HTML/JS - Both our web map and our admin panel need HTML and Javascript support on the frontend (React.js, google maps, query).  And API work on backend (node.js).

- Android - The app is functioning well, but we needs a UX overhaul to make it rock solid and easy to use for our users in the Africa field. It needs more testing and crash debugging.  Either you are an app breaker or an app fixer —  we need both!

- DevOps - Currently taken up by @Matt. We have Jenkins in place and could use more support getting our CI/CD pipelines dialed in for node.js and Android.

- Node.js unit testing - We only have partial coverage of our API in our unit tests, which means we cannot reliability validate new commits for continuous deployment.  We are using Mocha/Chai to write automated tests, and this should be straightforward for anyone with basic unit testing experience.

- Cloud - Docker, chef, or your favorite deployment tools, help us automate the rollout of new features to our production infrastructure.

- Database - Treetracker is currently powered by postGRES/postGIS.  As our database grows to millions of trees, our clustering algorithms are going to need aggressive optimization.

- Image processing - blurred/invalid image detection, duplicate image detection. AWS Lambda? - let's get our analysis pipeline rolling.

- Security Review

# Contributing to The Cause
Help us star and fork our repositories.

### Join The team
* Fill out the [Join-the-team-form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe61HDJKVH16vtTxhXpbwCH-wTVN1e6XoVU1riWjJ-ne5SIiA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

* Ask to be added to the team on Github. 

* If you already know how, feel free to just fork, build and pull.

* If the words 'fork and pull' doesn't make sense, please read up on Github below. 

**Think Agile - Small Iterations - Clearly Defined Commits.**
  
 * Keep your commits small - if you worked on three issues make three commits etc. 
 
 * Small commites help the reviewer
 
 * Lots of small commits make your profile look cooler.
 
* When in doubt, ask.

## Your first contribution
* Find a task you would like to work on by browsing the repositories' issue lists below. 
* Let others know what you are working on - post your intentions in the relevant slack channel or Github comments. 
* If you don't find something now, be persistent.

## Project Repositories

*In its most basic form this platform is designed to collect tree images from an android application and display these images on web-maps that can be served on other organizations' websites. In its more advanced form, we are verifying individual planter's efforts by tracking individual trees over time and creating results-based employment.*

## Basic Git Hub skills required!
If you have not heard of a **pull request** it is time for you to join over 27 million developers and learn this version control platform. There are lots of cool articles to get you up to speed: [Github Introduction](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) [Forking a Repository in Github](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), [Synicing a Fork in Github](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)

**We use the Fork and Pull model.**

Basics: 
* Fork the repository
* All changes you make must be submitted for review via a pull request to the appropriate branch.
* Ask for clarification if needed (via Git pull requests or Slack). 
* Report problems.

### Slack Basics
[Slack link](https://join.slack.com/t/greenstand/shared_invite/enQtMjcyMzgyMjk4NzU3LWZmNjM3YzY5N2Q0MzQ5YTM4OGZkMWJhM2U4MTkyYjI2NjhkN2YxNTRiMDIwNWQ5ZTVlNDczYzBjZmMxYzM2ZjU)
Slack is our main form of communication. Here are some Slack basics: 
To add yourself to the desired channels: on the left window in Slack find **channel +**... 

Our popular channels are #development, #android, #nodejs-api, #tree-talk etc..

* Speak out! Public messages build our team and keep us motivated. Use Public channels as much as possible. 
* Keep your messages in the relevant channels - talk about android in the android channel etc..
* Ask any question - we are friendly and all learning together. General tech questions go in #development, other questions in #general, Android questions in #android etc.
* Pointless chatter goes in #random channel
* Opening *Threads* to reply keeps channels cleaner.
