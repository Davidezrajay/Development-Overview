Creative Brief

**1. Background / Overview**

What's the big picture? 
Greenstand, a non profit organization, is the carrier of an idea, a concept using technology to establish tree planting as an economically profitable industry. We see this global open source database as the backbone of upcoming eco crypto currencies. 
The idea of an open and free mechanism to allow anybody anywhere to participate and invest in the sustainable climate mitigation in elevating trees growing as the most important industry on the planet.

What's going on in the market? 

Climate change forcing rethinking the true value of trees. 
Massive unjoint forces
- Carbon Offset Market looking for value chains
- Trees are trending!  
- Lack of transparency in tree planting and maintenance (true success rate)
- Corporate Industries Focus on Sustainability not just CSR
- The market is being growing into a global industry
- Growing awareness of human impact on the planet 
- Social Media as part of the digital revolution has given individuals the tools to participate in global change
- Ability to tell a global story
- Anything happening on the client side that the creative team should know about? 
- Greenstand is in need of a globally accepted image

Opportunities or problems in the market:
- Lack of transparency creates the need to fill that gap
- Connect Donor / Funder / Investor with Planters and Growers
- Creating a global Database with all planting efforts captured
- Converting environmental value into economic value

2. Objective: What is the goal of the branding?
*Write a concise statement of the effect brand should have on consumers. 
Typically expressed as an action. And frequently focused on what the ad should make the audience think, feel, or do.*
 
3. Target audience: who are we talking to?

*An audience profile is more about how real people think, feel and behave than it is about numbers and percentages. The aim here is to paint a portrait of the audience - a verbal picture that the creative team can talk to and visualize. Start with a few basics:*
