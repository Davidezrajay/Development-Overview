### Tabs

Source files should always use the non-breaking space character for whitespace, and not tabs.  All tabs should be converted to space characters.

You can install this pre-commit hook to avoid accidentally adding tabs to your commits.   https://github.com/mrc/git-hook-library/blob/master/pre-commit.no-tabs  PRs won't be accepted until tabs are removed.
